# Physics Formula Machine

# Description
My first Python project from when I started learning. Solves physics formulas from Gr.11 Physics class.

# Updates
I went through everything and cleaned up the code a bit, however I have not had the chance to touch the addingForces.py module, which is extremely inefficient & buggy code from back when I thought all you needed to code were if statements.

# Suggestions
Feel free to report any errors or give suggestions under the "Issues" section of this repository. I'll try to update this project every so often until I remove the bugs, but I have majoratively moved on to other things considering this was my first ever Python program.

Enjoy, I guess :)
